Another year, another post!

This time writing about my experience setting up and configuring [Gitea](https://gitea.io) and [Woodpecker](https://woodpecker-ci.org) as a self-hosted Git setup with full CI/CD pipelines.

I've decided to make the repo for this blog public with a [simple CI script](https://tinker.nz/idanoo/m2.nz/src/branch/main/.woodpecker.yml) configured to do hands free deployments. I'm aware that using `git pull` over SSH is a poor-mans CI script, but it works as a proof of concept and I do plan to tidy it up in the futureâ„¢.
